# BrikkitPlugins
This a repository of Brikkit plugins. You can take a look at what plugins are available in the `package` file, and download them from the `plugins` folder.

## Contributing
It would be a welcome addition to create a web interface which allows a user to navigate through the `package` file, with features such as searching and direct download links for plugins. Furthermore, you could query each plugin repository and find out the number of stars and other relevant information. If you wish to implement this, add me on Discord for a discussion: n42k#0416.
